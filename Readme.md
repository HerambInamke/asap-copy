#### *Tech Stack*  
"To bring this fun idea to life, I’m planning to use a robust tech stack that touches on every key concept of full-stack development:  
- *Frontend*: Built with React (and Vite) paired with Tailwind CSS for a smooth, modern UI.  
- *Backend*: Node.js with Express will handle the server logic, while MongoDB and Mongoose will manage the data.  
- *Authentication*: Firebase could be an optional tool for secure user logins.  
- *Extras*: I’m considering Docker for containerization to streamline development and deployment.  

Since I'm still learning these technologies, this project will be a great opportunity to deepen my understanding and gain hands-on experience with them."
